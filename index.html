                            <h4>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</h4>
                            <p>During the development process, the main structure of the FunRun project remained largely unchanged from the initial 
                                iteration 0 vision and stories. However, the team had planned additional features such as sharing progress through 
                                images or other apps. While this feature was not ultimately included in the final product, the team is pleased with how 
                                the project turned out and believes it achieved its goal of making running more enjoyable and accessible to a wider demographic.</p>
                            <h4>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h4>
                            <p>During the development of the FunRun application, our team learned a lot about effective team and large project development. 
                                We found that GitLab was a great tool for collaboration, version control, and issue tracking, and we plan to continue using it 
                                in future projects. Additionally, we learned the importance of creating a clear architecture diagram and breaking down the project
                                 into manageable user stories with assigned issues to team members. This allowed for more efficient development and ensured that 
                                 everyone on the team was on the same page. Overall, we will continue to prioritize effective communication, planning, and 
                                 documentation in future team projects.</p>
                            <h4>Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?</h4>
                            <p>After completing the FunRun project, we can draw several conclusions about what we've done. Firstly, we learned that effective communication 
                                is essential for successful teamwork. Without clear communication, team members may end up working on different parts of the project or may 
                                not be aware of changes made by others, leading to confusion and delays.

                                <br> We also found that version control, specifically GitLab, is an excellent tool for managing 
                                and tracking changes to the project's codebase. It provides a centralized repository for all team members to access 
                                and update the code, making it easy to collaborate and keep track of changes made by each team member.
                                
                                <br> Furthermore, we realized that organizing the code into different layers or 
                                components is crucial to keep the codebase manageable and maintainable. This separation of concerns allows for easier debugging, testing, 
                                and maintenance, making the codebase more scalable and efficient in the long run.
                                
                               <br>In conclusion, the FunRun project has taught us the importance of effective communication, version control, and proper code organization.
                                 We plan to apply these lessons in future large-scale projects to ensure a smoother development process.
